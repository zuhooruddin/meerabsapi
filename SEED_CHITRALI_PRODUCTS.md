## Product Features

- ✅ Unique slugs and SKUs
- ✅ Realistic pricing (category-specific ranges)
- ✅ Detailed descriptions
- ✅ Stock management enabled
- ✅ Some products marked as "New Arrival" or "Featured"
- ✅ Proper category relationships
- ✅ All products are Chitrali-specific

## Notes

- The script uses a product counter starting from 100000 to avoid conflicts
- Products are linked to their respective categories via `CategoryItem` table
- All products have manufacturer set to "Meerab's Wardrobe"
- Prices include MRP, Sale Price, and Discount percentages

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. **Duplicate slug/SKU errors**: The script automatically skips duplicates
2. **Category already exists**: The script uses `get_or_create` to handle existing categories
3. **Database connection**: Ensure your database is properly configured

## After Running

After the script completes:

1. Check your admin panel to see the new products
2. Verify categories are properly structured
3. Products should appear on your website under "Chitrali Products"
4. All products will be searchable and filterable by category

## Customization

To modify the script:

1. Edit `chitralhivedjango/inara/management/commands/seed_chitrali_products.py`
2. Adjust product counts in `subcategories_data`
3. Modify product names, prices, or descriptions in `product_templates`
4. Run the command again (it will skip existing products)

## Important

- **Backup your database** before running if you have existing data
- The script is idempotent - safe to run multiple times
- Existing products with same slug/SKU will be skipped
